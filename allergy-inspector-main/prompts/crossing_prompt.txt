[safety status, ingredient emoji, ingredient name, description]

Guidelines:
1. safety status should be:
   - dangerous if the ingredient contains the allergen.
   - alert if there is a mild risk or possible cross-contamination.
   - safe if there is no allergy risk.
2. The ingredient emoji should visually represent the ingredient (e.g., ðŸ¥› for milk, ðŸŒ° for nuts).
3. Include only ingredients present in the list; avoid repetition and adding extra items.
4. Structure the list by ranking from most dangerous to safest.
5. Description must be informative, short with a maximum of 2 lines and related to Ingredients.

Return the list strictly in this format and avoid any additional commentary outside the template.
