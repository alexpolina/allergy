INSTRUCTIONS:
1. You MUST return each ingredient in the EXACT bracket format:
   [safety status, ingredient emoji, ingredient name, "short description"]
2. One line per ingredient, no extra text or commentary.
3. The "safety status" must be:
   - dangerous if the ingredient definitely contains an allergen,
   - alert if partial cross-contamination is possible,
   - safe otherwise.
4. The "ingredient emoji" is an appropriate emoji for that ingredient 
   (e.g. 🍅 for tomato, 🥛 for milk, 🍞 for bread).
5. The "ingredient name" is the ingredient string from the list (or a concise label).
6. The "short description" is at most 2 lines, referencing the allergen risk. Please also check cross-reactivity with oral pollen syndrome.
   Example for a peanut sauce:
   [dangerous, 🥜, peanut sauce, "Contains peanuts. High allergy risk."]

**DO NOT** include bullet points or additional commentary.  
Just bracketed items, one per line.
